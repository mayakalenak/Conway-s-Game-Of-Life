# Conway's Game Of Life Overview

Conway's Game of Life is a simulation of the trends in the behavior of living cells. In this simulation a higher initial chance/density of alive cells causes more living cells in the final state of the simulation, also, a larger grid size causes a higher probablility of living cells. 


# Main Features

- Examine the effect of grid size on the probability of alive cells
- Customizable grid size and chance/density of alive cells
- Idenitify number of alive cells in each grid iteration
- Graphical User Interface: Reset simulation, Alter speed of simulation, Terminate simulation


# Execute

- Download and run .zip file

- To see the number of alive cells in each iteration (i.e.: see .csv file)
- Type:
    java LandsscapeSimulation.java
  into terminal running python code from .zip file
  
- To see GUI (i.e.: change speed, and have ability to reset and end simulation)
- Type:
    java LandsscapeDisplay.java
  into terminal running python code from .zip file
